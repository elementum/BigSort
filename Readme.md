Manual guide to run the sorter.

Open FileSorter\appsettings.json and add as many folders for temporary files as many drives you have.
The more drives you have the more performance you gain. Make sure folders are located on different drives, otherwise duplicates are ignored.

Run build-and-run.txt batch file, to generate a 10GB file and sort it.
If you want to supply different parameters, either change them in batch file or run projects directly.
